        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello,
        
        I am a **Senior Software Engineer** with a strong passion for merging data with emerging technologies. I have over **4
        years of experience** in software engineering, with a focus on JavaScript, React.JS, Node.JS, and Typescript. I also
        have extensive experience working with Postgres, Cassandra, and SQL.
        
        In my previous roles, I have developed new products, applications, and services to power businesses while improving and
        maintaining existing ones. I have a proven track record of demonstrating urgency, prioritization, and ownership to drive
        issues to completion, all while tracking towards bigger OKRs.
        
        I am always on top of tech trends, and I enjoy experimenting with and learning new technologies. I actively participate
        in internal and external technology communities and have mentored other members of the engineering community.
        
        I have collaborated with digital product managers to deliver robust cloud-based solutions that drive powerful
        experiences to help millions of Americans achieve financial empowerment. I am proficient in using programming languages
        like JavaScript, Python, SQL, Node, Open Source RDBMS and NoSQL databases, Container Orchestration services including
        Docker and Kubernetes, and a variety of AWS tools and services.
        
        I hold a Master's Degree and have at least 4 years of experience in software engineering. I have 2+ years of
        experience with AWS, GCP, Azure, or another cloud service, and 2+ years of experience in Agile practices and open source
        frameworks. I also have 1+ years of experience working with ML algorithms and models.
        
        I am currently seeking opportunities where I can leverage my skills and experiences to drive major transformations
        within organizations like Capital One Shopping, working on identification and network integration to highlight new
        users.
        
        Thank you for considering my application.
        
        Best regards,
        Dino
